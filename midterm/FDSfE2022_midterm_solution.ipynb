        "# CONTEXT : Investigation of sea level rise \n",
        "\n",
        "Sea level rise, associated with global warming, is a threat to people living in costal areas and to world sustainability. Sea level rise is caused primarily by two factors related to global warming: the added water from melting ice sheets and glaciers, and the expansion of seawater as it warms. The [data you are given access to is from NASA](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/sea-level/), which tracks the change in global sea level since 1993, as observed by satellites.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Objective**: modeling sea level rise to enable predictions and predict future sea levels and critical rise points.\n",
        "\n",
        "## RULES\n",
        "\n",
        "Work on your own! you will have a short \"interview\" with Dr. Bianco after the midterm. In that interview you will have to show that you can redo any piece of the midterm you did on the day of. If you copy you will not be able to redo the work and you will get 0 points for the midterm. Code that is similar is easily spotted and you will be asked about it. Whether you are the person that copied or the person that allows a classmate to copy you will get 0 points for the midterm.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can consult your old notebooks, my notebooks, stackoverflow, books, tarot cards... pretty much anything you want! This is an open-everything exam and anything that does not involve live interaction with a classmate (or another person that is not Dr. Bianco, Mr. Qamar, or Ms. Fortino) is allowed\n",
        "\n",
        "Use the #midterm slack channel to ask questions. Do not hesitate to ask for clarifications and do not stay stuck on any task too long! Give it an honest try and if you have questions ask in #midterm.\n",
        "\n",
        "You will receive points for each of the marked tasks and for the discussion of your findings.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Tasks:\n",
        "**Task 1: Data Acquisition(15 points)** The first task is to read in the data. The format of the dataset makes it tricky. This task may be time consuming. DO NOT STAY STUCK HERE! If you _cannot_ figure out how to do this, after an honest try,  you can [use this link for a better formatted dataset here . If you use this secondary link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fedhere/FDSfE_FBianco/main/test/searise.csv) instead. This is a properly formatted csv file. You will not receive full points for task 1, but if you have partial solutions in your notebook you may receive partial credits.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Task 2-6: Data Exploration (35 points)** are the exploratory data tasks: we did these kind of things in many notebooks together in class and in homeworks. Each thing I ask you to do has been done in a class or another. This is likely the most time consuming aspect of the midterm\n",
        "\n",
        "**Task 7: Data Visualization (20 points)** Data visualization tasks\n",
        "\n",
        "**Task 8-10: Model the data and make predictions (20 points)** Modeling tasks: you can choose whichever method you want to fit a line model to the data. The notebook we worked on in the past 4 classes contains the way to use each method. The \"solution\" to that homework is in https://github.com/fedhere/FDSfE_FBianco/blob/main/classdemo/linear_regression_in_detail.ipynb\n",

        "- removes the instructions and provides the solution in their place - is named sensibly \n",
        "- uses good coding practices (encouraged but not grading on this last item)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Broken notebook (-15%)** If your notebook does not work when we receive it by \"Run all\" you will lose 15% of the points. Make sure you \"restart and run all\" before you submit\n",
        "\n",
        "**Do not stay stuck on the first task (acquiring the data) for too long! If you cannot read in the data you can skip that task and lose points for it but be able to proceed to the other tasks! and you can go back to it later!!**"
