# Due 10/26 at midnight

Upload a _working_ notebook to your repo under folder HW5 based on 

https://github.com/fedhere/FDSfE_FBianco/blob/main/HW5/Multiple_Linear_Regression.ipynb

which shows the exact same outputs as my code cell by cell by adding your code in the cells with the comment "# -- your code here" and text answers that replace "*your answer here*".

Remember to always appropriately label the axes of your plots, and include a caption describing the plot and the important information it conveys.
